    Directory: w45/e09
    Objective:
        - Create a 2D array representing a simulation grid for simple life forms, 
            where 1 is an alive cell and 0 is a dead cell. 
        - Implement the rules of Conway’s Game of Life and simulate it for 6 iterations.
        - https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
    Expected Output: 
        - Print the grid after each iteration, showing how cells evolve based on the rules.
